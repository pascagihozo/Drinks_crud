        I attended a single-sex boys school for my Advanced Level Studies. Well, it did have girls at A level of course! After which I took a whole gap year, working while waiting for my transition to university.

       <h4>Moving to ALU to begin studying.</h4>
       <p style="font-size: 18px;">I had a lot of separation anxiety as a child, afraid of copying with new places or environments. But to my surprise, moving to a whole different school, in a different country with complete strangers was part of the bravest decisions I have ever made in my life. My first few days in Mauritius were not so tourist-friendly as I had to stay locked up in a hotel to quarantine as the Covid situation was a bit intense. However, the moving process and preparations were all enjoyable for me as most people back home were trying to have the best last moments with me and it was a pretty nice farewell.ocuments and retook medical tests

        <h4>Meeting other students..</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">The excitement and rush of getting to know who is who behind their social media pictures was absolutely fun for me. It’s quite a small school,  it took me almost a month to get to know everyone in my year group.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Funny enough, my biggest lesson in university is that students will always do an assignment the night before it’s due.  Battling between meeting up with deadlines, trying to make it to class with a heavy hangover and also trying to balance a social life is a real sport in university. My favourite courses have been Web Development and Software Engineering.</p>
