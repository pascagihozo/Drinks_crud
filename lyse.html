            I tend to be more introverted so I was intrigued by the idea of

            breaking the barrier of the awkward phase where people are just
            getting to know each. Quickly, I made quite a number of
            acquaintances, few of whom turned into friendships in the long run.

            We have gained massive knowledge but that which marks me the most is
            during our Leadeship core. We learnt some data analysis skills that

            orally, and project management. These lessons set a great stepping
            stone for our various chosen majors that we began to study in our

            Always stay true to who are and who you want to become but also
            allowing yourself to grow. Do not confuse the thoughts and ideas of
            your friends for you own. You personality is what makes you unique

            ALC has definitely been a mix emotions from struggling with
            interpersonal relationships to making local friends. Adjusting to
            heavy workload. Exploring the island finally once all COVID-19
            restrictions were removed. I faced challenges in all areas of my
            life and handling was hard being away from home but we are entering
            a new phase where we get to study and dive deeper into the mauritian
            experience. Looking forward to improve my academic and social life
