              I heard about ALU from my friend, Lina Kwayu, who just got the scholarship to study at ALU Rwanda. One night she called and inspired me to apply for the scholarship and I just did.

        I remember after I got the scholarship to study at ALU, I had sleepless nights just thinking of the day that I will finally move to Mauritius. This was my first time travelling abroad so I really couldn't wait until when the day finally reached where I got to Mauritius. I remember when we landed at the airport and the crew members just said, "Welcome to the paradise island!". I was like 'Ohh my God! I really did it'. LOL!!!

        The first person I met was Nabila, who was my seatmate in the flight and we had a good chat on the 4-hour flight learning about each other's origin. When we arrived and had to stay at the hotel for quarantine, I remember chatting with Pascal, he became my very good friend even before we even met. Then luckily, he became my roommate. It was such good luck for me, Pascal was such a warm-hearted roommate and we became nice buddies though I cause troubles most of the times. Haha!

          The first year of ALU, we took classes on learning about leadership where the topics taught covered the skills necessary for the 21st century modern world. After that year, we began doing our degree programs from Glasgow Caledonian University, and I was enrolled in my dream course, Computing.

        <h4>Advice to prospective students.</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        Today, my biggest advice to prospcetive students is that whenever they are making decision of the best university to study in Africa, it should be ALU. The university has a diverse community of people with its Leadership Core program which makes it even unique and very helpful in generating the next-generation of African leaders.

        <h4>A resume of your time at ALU so far.</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">At ALU, I got the opportunity to work as the university's social media intern and apart from that I was able to start my own businesses on campus including a cocktail bar which was later closed due to some reasons. I then later started a cab business (Under G Rides), driving students around the island.</p>

        When I got the cab, I was able to visit many places. I had a very interesting adventure moving around different places around the island. Some fo the best places I have ever been are La Vallee des Coulors Nature park, Funzone Mauritius and Sunset catamaran.
