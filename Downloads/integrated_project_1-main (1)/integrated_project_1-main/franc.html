       <h4>Moving to ALU to begin studying.</h4>
       <p style="font-size: 18px;">Moving to ALU, specifically moving to Mauritius wasn’t that easy, 
        I remember I sent my VISA application to Mauritius but because of Lockdown it took more than 
        2 months to reach there, and at the time the documents reached 
        there they were already expired so I resent the documents and retook medical tests

            Computing it was qute hectic because it was my first time in Computer science. But I survived on
