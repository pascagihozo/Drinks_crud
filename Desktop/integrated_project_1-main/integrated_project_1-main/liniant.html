            Before coming to ALU, I was a student at Zengeza I High School.

            <p style="font-size: 18px">
                My first time hearing about ALU was through a college fair which was hosted by EducationUSA in which I was a member of. After listening to what the university was offering and what the alumni had achieved, I couldn't stop myself from applying to ALU.

        <h4>Why you wanted to study at ALU?</h4>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> 
            Just by hearing that ALU was the Harvard of Africa and how it focuses more on the missions not majors, as a young lady who was still in the process of discovering what i wanted to do, I just couldn’t stop myself from being part of those type of leaders who will bring positive change to Africa  and the world at large.

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            It was particularly difficult for me to move to the island as these were the horrifying times of Covid 19. Not only that but the VISA application process was ardous and stressful and the wait was no better. Luckily I got accepted without having to resubmit any documents.  Prices for COVID tests had plummeted as a strategy to stop people from traveling and this caused a strain on my family .

      <h4>The Application process and being accepted </h4>
      <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        My application process went smoothly since I had all the support I needed from my high school college advisors and I managed to finish the whole process in a week.

       <h4>Moving to ALU to begin studying.</h4>
       <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        The fact that we received an email in less than a week to travel to Mauritius caught my family and I offguard. I had to shop, prepare documents, test positive for multiple COVID tests while having to move around the city, and make sure to not forget anything. It was stressful to say the least but everything went according to plan and the night we landed in Mauritius, we were driven to our quarantine hotel and that marked the start of a scary but exciting college journey.

        <h4>Meeting other students..</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            Getting into the island , I tested positive for covid and had to isolate for more than 6 weeks. I missed orientation and the first weeks of class. I had no friends on campus and the time I was then taken to campus was a full blow for me as people had already made friends and groups. I met my roommate first and gradually from the classroom and cafeteria , started to meet other people.

            I started off with Leadership Core which was a refreshing, informative and interactive course. Moving on to my degree choice, Computing, I found the transition rather challenging as the classes like Software Engineering and Mathematics were more demanding but with time I got the hang of it.
