            I heard about ALU through social media. It was titled “The Harvard
            of Africa”, a very inticing topic that immediately caught my
            interest and I decided to delve deeper into the place.

        <p style="font-size: 18px">
          ALU unlike many universities focuses on the student’s passion and how
          they can use it to improve their community and make a living. With
          accredited professors and many programs outside of the norm class
          convention,ALU was a dream I wanted to become a part of.

          <h4>How you heard about ALU.</h4>
          <p style="font-size: 18px">
            My first time to hear ALU was when ALU students came to visit our
            school, in 2018. It was like marketing team because they came to
            syntehsize us to apply in ALU after High School later my brother
            interned in ALU so I started loving the University

            My application process, apart from the terrible internet connection
            back at home , went smoothly, it took me less than a month to
            receive my admission decision.

            It was particularly difficult for me to move to the island as these
            were the horrifying times of Covid 19. Not only that but the VISA
            application process was ardous and stressful and the wait was no
            better. Luckily I got accepted without having to resubmit any
            documents. Prices for COVID tests had plummeted as a strategy to
            stop people from traveling and this caused a strain on my family .

            Getting into the island , I tested positive for covid and had to
            isolate for more than 6 weeks. I missed orientation and the first
            weeks of class. I had no friends on campus and the time I was then
            taken to campus was a full blow for me as people had already made
            friends and groups. I met my roommate first and gradually from the
            classroom and cafeteria , started to meet other people.

            I started off with Leadership Core which was a refreshing,

            like Software Engineering and Mathematics were more demanding but
            with time I got the hang of it.
